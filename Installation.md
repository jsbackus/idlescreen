# Introduction #

Noted below are various notes on how to install the Idle Screen Project on supported operating systems.

# Windows 2000/XP/Vista #

Precompiled binaries are available for 32-bit versions of Windows.  The most current version is [idlescreen\_0.3\_Alpha\_win32.exe](http://idlescreen.googlecode.com/files/idlescreen_0.3_Alpha_win32.exe), and is available on the [Downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/idlescreen/downloads/list).  You can also compile the IdleScreen screen savers from scratch.  For more information, please see the page on [compiling the project](Compilation.md).

# Linux/FreeBSD #

Currently, there are not any precompiled binaries available for these systems.  Please see the page on [compiling the project](Compilation.md) for information on getting IdleScreen up and running.  You will need to install X-Screensaver in order to use the IdleScreen screensavers.

# Apple Mac #

As of yet, no one has tried to compile/use the IdleScreen project on a Mac, but if it works on Linux/FreeBSD, it should work under MacOS X, since it is based on BSD.  Please see the page on [compiling the project](Compilation.md) for information on getting IdleScreen up and running.  You will need to install X-Screensaver in order to use the IdleScreen screensavers.
