<h3>Profiles</h3>
<P>PlasmaLenz is capable of maintaining multiple
configuration profiles, which it will either
randomly or sequentially select at each invocation.
The box on the left of the
dialog box contains the list of available profiles,
and the box on the right contains the list of
currently selected profiles.  Profiles are added
to the selected list by selecting them in the box
on the list, and clicking the ">>" button.  Clicking
the "<<" button will remove any selected profiles
in the box on the right.  Pushing the "Up" button
will move the currently selected profile in the box
on the right up in the list, and the "Down" button
will move the selected profile down in the list. 
Below the list of
selected profiles is the check box to enable or
disable random profile selection, as well as the
field that determines the history size, or
the number of profiles that must be used before
a profile can be repeated.</p>
<h3>Creating, Editing, and Deleting Profiles</h3>
<p>To create a new profile, simply click the "New"
button under the list of available profiles on
the left.  This will bring up the 
<a href="ProfileEditDialog.html">Profile Editor</a>
dialog box with an empty profile.
  To edit a profile, select the
profile to edit in the box on the left and click
the "Edit" button.  This will open the
<a href="ProfileEditDialog.html">Profile Editor</a>
dialog box for the selected profile.
Clicking delete will permanently delete the profile
that is currently selected in the box on the left.
For more information on the Profile Editor
and the various profile settings, please
click <a href="ProfileEditDialog.html">here</a> 
or on "Help" in the Profile Editor dialog box.</p>
<h3>Palettes and the Palette Editor</h3>
<h2 color="#FF0000">Insert Picture of Palette Editor
Dialog</h2>
<p>All configuration profiles contain references
to a color palette.  Palettes are separate entities,
and multiple configuration profiles can reference
the same palette.  To create/edit/delete palettes
without opening the 
<a href="ProfileEditDialog.html">Profile Editor</a>,
simply click
the "Palette Editor" button below the list of
available profiles.  This brings up a dialog that allows
you to add new palettes, duplicate an existing
palette, edit an existing palette, or delete a palette.
Note that all palettes must have unique names.  Clicking
"Duplicate" will prompt you for a new, unique, name
for the palette.  Clicking on "New" or "Edit" will
bring up the 
<a href="IndexedPaletteDialog.html">Palette Editor</a>.
For mor information
on the Palette Editor and on palettes, please click
<a href="IndexedPaletteDialog.html">here</a> or
on "Help" in the Palette Editor dialog box.</p>
<h3>Importing and Exporting</h3>
<p>PlasmaLenz allows you to import and export
some or all of your profiles and palettes to an
XML file.  This allows you to backup, restore, and share
your favorite settings with ease.  To export your
settings, simply click "Export Settings" on the right
side of the dialog box, select the settings you wish
to save, click "Export", then enter the name of
the file to export to.  To import settings, simply
click on "Import Settings" on the right side of
the dialog box, navigate to the file you wish to import,
select the profiles and/or palettes to import, then
click "Import".</p>
<h3>Final Notes</h3>
<p>If you make a mistake, take heart!  None of the
settings are actually saved to disk until you click
"Ok" or "Apply".  Clicking "Cancel" will abandon any and
all changes you have made since the last save.</p>
