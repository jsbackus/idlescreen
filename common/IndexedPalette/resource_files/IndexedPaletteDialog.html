<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>In the days before "true color" was prevalent, graphics cards
had to maintain a list of colors, called a palette, because
the amount of memory available to the cards was very limited.
Palettes as defined here are the same in that they are a 
fixed-length
list of available colors in a specific order.  These
palettes go a step further and provide a second dimension, the
meaning of which is different depending on the application
using the palette.
The X direction (from left to right), is referred
to as the primary direction, and the Y direction (from top
to bottom) is referred to as the secondary direction.  These
palettes also have the ability to interpolate the undefined
colors between two defined colors.  This is useful for building
palettes that contain gradients.  The last bit of data
contained with in each palette is a default color that is
used when a color is undefined and color interpolation is
not enabled.</p>
<h3>Parameter Specifics</h3>
<p>Below is a list of parameters and their meanings.</p>
<ul><li><b>Palette Name</b> - This is the symbolic name
of the palette.  The value of this field must be
unique per application.</li>
<li><b>Default Color</b> - Clicking on this button will allow
you to define the default color for this palette.  The default
is black (#000000).</li>
<li><b>Width, Height</b> - These are the width (X) and
height (Y) dimensions of the palette.  After changing
the numbers, it is necessary to click the "Resize" button to
actually resize the palette.  This isn't done by default, 
because this can be a fairly CPU intensive task.  Note: if
you chose a dimension that is <i>smaller</i> than the current
dimension, you will lose any colors that are outside of the new
dimension.</li>
<li><b>Interpolate Colors</b> - When this is checked, the
palette will attempt to calculate the values of all undefined
colors by interpolating between defined colors when the
palette is instantiated in the client application.</li>
<li><b>Linear Interpolation</b> - When this is selected, 
linear interpolation is used, of the form 
C(i) = C(s) + ( (i - start) / (stop - start) ) *
C(stop - start).</li>
<li><b>Sinusoidal Interpolation</b> - When this is selected,
sinusoidal interpolation is used, of the form 
C(i) = C(s) + sin( (i - start)*PI / (2*(stop - start)) ) *
C(stop - start).  This mode may produce smoother color
gradients in some cases.</li>
<li><b>Wrap Colors</b> - When this option is enabled, during
the interpolation phase, the palette will wrap around to the 
first defined color when interpolating the values for all
undefined colors after the last defined color.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How To Edit the Colors</h3>
<p>The region in the middle contains a table of the currently
defined colors, with undefined colors grouped together.  Below
this table is a preview area which shows how the palette will
look when loaded in the client program.  The preview
area will show the effects of interpolation when
it is enabled.  To define a previously undefined color,
first figure out where you want it to go in relation to
the other colors in the palette.  If the cell where you
wish to define a color is within a group, double-click on the
group.  This brings up the "Insert Color" dialog box, shown
here.</p>
<h1>Insert picture of Insert Color Dialog Box</h1>
<p>This dialog box asks for the coordinates of the cell to
split out on its own.  Remember that these numbers start at 0.
Click "Ok" to split up the cell group, or "Cancel" to cancel.
After clicking "Ok", you will see that there are one or
two new columns (depending if the target cell was on the 
outside of the group), with the target cell by itself.  You
can now define the color by double-clicking the cell.  This
will bring up the Color Chooser.  You can change already
defined colors by double-clicking on the color to bring up
the Color Chooser.  Additionally you can copy defined colors
and paste them in defined or ungrouped undefined cells by
right-clicking on the target cell.  To delete an already
defined color, simply right-click on the target cell and
choose "Delete".</p>
<h3>Important Notes</h3>
<p>Some important things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul><li>Changes are not saved until you click "Ok".  Clicking
"Cancel" will discard any changes made.</li>
<li>If you screw up, you can click "Revert" to reset the
palette to what it was when the dialog was first opened.</li>
<li>You can save incremental changes by clicking "Ok" and
editing the palette repeatedly.  <b>This is a GOOD idea.</b></li>
<li>If you resize the palette with a dimension that is smaller
than the corresponding current dimension, any colors outside
of the new width or height will be lost.</li>
<li>When interpolating, you should always define a color
in the column 0.</li>
<li>When interpolating in the Y direction, for each column,
there must be a defined color at row 0.</li>
<li>When dealing with large palettes, disabling interpolation
will reduce the amount of work the preview display has to
do after each color change.  When done changing colors,
you can re-enable interpolation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Example of how the "Classic RGB" palette was defined.</p>
<ol><li>First, create a new palette.</li>
<li>Name the palette.</li>
<li>Set the Width to 192 and the Height to 1, then click
"Resize".</li>
<li>Double-click the group of undefined colors.</li>
<li>Insert a new color at 0,0 and click "Ok".</li>
<li>Double-click on cell 0,0, and choose a red color.</li>
<li>Double-click on the group of undefined colors.</li>
<li>Insert a new color at 63,0 and click "Ok".</li>
<li>Double-click on the cell at 63,0 and choose a green color.
</li>
<li>Double-click on the group of undefined colors at
locations 64.0 through 191,0.</li>
<li>Insert a new color at 127,0 and click "Ok".</li>
<li>Double-click on the cell at 127,0 and choose a blue color.
</li>
<li>Enable "Interpolate Colors"</li>
<li>Select "Linear"</li>
<li>Enable "Wrap Colors"</li>
<li>Click "Ok"</li>
</ol>
<p>That wasn't too bad, now was it?</p>
