# Introduction #

Randomizer isn't so much an actual screen saver as it is a utility that will randomly pick a screen saver from a list of desired screen savers every time the system runs a screen saver.  It also has the ability to change the screen savers after a set period of time.  This  utility is only available on Windows systems, because X-Screensaver is available on the `*`NIX based systems, which is what all of these screen savers require to run on the `*`NIX based systems, anyway.
