> #### Why use Qt instead of MSFC or GTK+? ####
MSFC was ruled out because it isn't cross-platform compatible.  As for choosing Qt over GTK+, unfortunately I don't have a good answer.  I liked Qt's look a little bit better, and when I was deciding, Qt's Window's port seemed more stable.  No, I didn't do a thorough evaluation.  Qt met the needs of the project and provided a rich API to develop with.

> #### Why did you release the code under GPLv2 instead of GPLv3 or another OSS-approved license? ####
Version 2 of the GPL is what I am most familiar with, plus Qt is released under GPLv2.  I chose not to go with version 3, because version 2 met all of my needs, with the exception that version 2 might technically prohibit distribution via BitTorrent.  For the record, users are expressly permitted to distribute code and executables related to this project as long as they are in compliance with all other aspects of the GPLv2.
